# We use 'local_role_data' directly here rather than requiring it be passed as an input, since it is VERY VERY BAD
# if an accidental input mistake results in a bucket with a policy that doesn't permit anyone to manage it; that bucket
# can't be deleted or changed by anyone, it lasts forever. Avoiding that risk is worth breaking separation of concerns
# a bit and fetching 'local_role_data' multiple times.
