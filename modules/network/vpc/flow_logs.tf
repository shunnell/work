# Emit flow logs to a CWLG, and then ship that CWLG to Splunk via firehose and a remote destination.
# TODO this is going to be very inefficient and expensive. Instead, this code should be replaced with a direct-to-firehose
# cross-account write to the firehose shipping to Splunk. That'll require changes to log shipping code, namely:
# 1. Update the Firehose destination module with cross-account support per https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/firehose-cross-account-delivery.html
# 2. Put in place a new lambda that processes flow-log-type data rather than CWLG type data: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/partners/streamline-your-amazon-vpc-flow-logs-ingestion-to-splunk.html
# 3. Update this module to take a Firehose ARN instead of a CW destination ARN and remove/update the below code.
